# Forecaster_ShinyApp
A shiny app to input the univariate or multivariate dataset and obtain a time series model with forecasts

Note: 
* The dataset should contain the data in the ascending order of the date (ex: 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023,... )
* The users can input a univariate dataset, then the app will fit a univariate time series model appropriately by optimizing the parameters.
* The users can input a multivariate dataset, then the app will fit a multivariate time series model appropriately by optimizing the parameters.
